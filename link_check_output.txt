    in element <p>In November of 1845 Washington’s newspapers, including the <em>National Intelligencer, </em>and <em>The Union</em>, reported on Mayor William Winston Seaton’s proclamation of November 27 as a “Day of Thanksgiving,” it being the city’s first observance of the holiday. Maryland’s Governor Thomas Pratt had issued a Thanksgiving proclamation earlier in October, also setting November 27 as the day for that states’ observance.<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190606115013/http://intowner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/NOV-WhatOnceWas-pic1.jpg"></a></p>

    in element <p>As the 1840s progressed an increasing number of state governors adopted the holiday and proclaimed the observance of a day of thanksgiving in late November or early December. Federal holidays simply did not exist. The only other precedent might have been from the early days of the Republic, when Presidents George Washington and John Adams had each had proclaimed a day of thanksgiving as a religious observance.<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190606115013/http://intowner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/NOV-WhatOnceWas-pic2.png"></a></p>

    in element <p>William Winston Seaton was a fixture in the life of Washington city for five decades. A newspaperman, he was co-editor of the city’s paper of record, the <em>National Intelligencer.</em> A Whig politician, he served as president of the city’s Board of Aldermen from 1819 to 1831 and later was mayor for five terms, from 1840 to 1850. He was a member of the First Unitarian Church (now All Souls Church, Unitarian). An element of Unitarian doctrine is thanksgiving, so that may have influenced this first Washington observance.<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190606115013/http://intowner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/NOV-WhatOnceWas-pic4.jpg"></a></p>

    in element <p>Washington has developed some of its own Thanksgiving holiday traditions. In the 1850s the Washington Monument Society tried to fundraise for construction of the monument. At the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th racing at Benning’s track was a popular pastime — first horses, then automobiles. The early 20th century saw the fierce rivalry of the Howard-Lincoln Thanksgiving football game.<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190606115013/http://intowner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/NOV-WhatOnceWas-pic7.jpg"></a></p>

    in element <p>Turkeys for the Presidential table came from Rhode Island poulterer Horace Vose from 1873 to 1913. Public presentation of a turkey to the President seems to date back to the 1920s. Granting an official pardon to that turkey is a much more recent tradition. Surely to the surprise of many, the first President to pardon the White House Thanksgiving turkey was George H.W. Bush in 1989.<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190606115013/http://intowner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/NOV-WhatOnceWas-pic9.jpg"></a></p>

In 1871, Georgetown had lost nearly all of its separate legal existence with the creation of the District’s new territorial government. The very use of the name was contentious for years and the area was redubbed West Washington. A provision in the 1871 act allowed Georgetown’s ordinances to continue in effect, an anomalous situation legally rectified with the total <a href="http://intowner.com/2016/11/19/the-liquor-license-did-it-georgetown-as-a-separate-and-independent-city-by-law-is-hereby-abolished/">abolition of Georgetown</a> in 1895.</p>

    in element <p>District government is working on obtaining curation space so we can consolidate and manage the District’s archaeological collections in in a location that meets archival standards. The DC Public Library is adding a new floor onto the MLK, Jr. main library building, and we are negotiating for floor space in the new archival storage area. Because the project entails adverse effects to a National Register-listed landmark building, the library has agreed in principle. There is an environmental assessment out for public comment that includes a draft Memorandum of Agreement with language for providing that space. If you don’t mind and you have the time, <u>please</u> review it and let them know what you think about it. This is something we’ve been working towards for years, and it’s extremely exciting for us to finally make some headway. <a href="https://www.ncpc.gov/project/mlklibrary/">https://www.ncpc.gov/project/mlklibrary/</a></p>

    in element <p>A charming term of art of the day for air conditioning was “manufactured weather.” Manufacturing the weather for Washington was a long-time concern, as Washington was a southern town with an average high temperature in July of over 80 degrees. Peter Charles L’Enfant’s plan set Washington City across the Tiber Creek, imagining it as suitable for transportation when transformed into a canal. The canal was developed, as <a href="http://intowner.com/2016/03/20/high-handed-usurpation-and-outrage-the-end-of-washington-city-canal">Washington City Canal</a> which emptied into the Potomac just west of the Washington Monument.</p>

Presidents routinely retreated northward to the Soldiers’ Home or other high grounds to escape summer heat and miasmatic vapors, smells, and mosquitoes.</p>

He’d been moved, at his insistence, when it was clear he could never recover. His body was brought back to the capital for lying-in-state. Garfield was Capitol only the sixth man to lie in state in the rotunda. This, the second presidential assassination, was in some ways more shocking than the first – Guiteau, seemingly merely motivated by office-seeking but actually delusional, unlike Booth who was seeking revenge for the South’s loss in the Civil War.</p>

    in element <p>Unfortunately, despite high hopes that the museum would become a much visited off-the-Mall tourist attraction in addition to being of huge interest to DC residents, the venture was short-lived and, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A18694-2004Oct8.html">as reported at the time</a> by the <em>Washington Post</em>, closed after less than two years, leaving only the library and Society offices and a couple of second floor galleries for temporary exhibits and occasional lectures and special events. (Possibly the ultimate demise of the ambitious museum undertaking was <a href="http://thesitehub.com/InTowner_archive/2003September.pdf">foretold by a commentary</a> that was published on page 16 of the September 2003 issue of <em>The InTowner</em>.)</p>

    in element <p>Not really. There are some other mapping projects in DC we admire—including a “Literary Map of Metropolitan Washington, DC” that Martha Hopkins made for the Washington Chapter of the Women’s National Book Association almost twenty years ago. That map, which was never digitized, includes 36 authors. The DC Public Library created an online map called “<a href="https://www.dcbythebook.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">DC By the Book</a>” showing locations where books of fiction are set. There are literary maps of <a href="http://www.nyslittree.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">New York State</a> and the <a href="http://xroads.virginia.edu/~ma04/kane/thesis/map.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Commonwealth of Virginia</a>. But I don’t know of anyone else who is researching a single city with as much depth as we are. And, while we want to document the well-known writers who lived here, we are just as excited to find residences of writers who are lesser known—which also makes our site unique.</p>

    in element <p>Georgetown and Washington society (up to the highest echelons) appreciated horse racing since before the founding of Washington — even presidents were involved in the racing scene, and John Quincy Adams was known to attend the races. President Andrew Jackson entered his horses under the name of his nephew A.J. Donelson when he raced them in Washington. Wendy Kail’s “On the Track — Thomas Peter, Henry Clay, and the Duchess of Marlborough” <a href="https://www.tudorplace.org/article/reading-room-georgetown-and-the-federal-city/on-the-track-thomas-peter-henry-clay-and-the-duchess-of-marlborough/">recounts early Georgetown horse racing</a>, starting in 1769. The first steeplechase in the United States took place in Washington in 1834, hosted by the Washington Jockey Club on October 19th.</p>

In the Spring of 2019, Congress passed the Federal Lands bill; a provision in the bill allowed the District of Columbia to contract for improvements to parks under National Park Service jurisdiction. The District government chose Franklin Square to be the first to be transformed, given this new opportunity. The District has been constantly frustrated by the inability of the underfunded NPS to adequately maintain its parks in the District.</p>

    in element <p>Was the idea of a parking structure under Franklin Square so absurd? Parking under parks was more prevalent out west. In 1942 parking was built under San Francisco’s Union Square. Pershing Square in Los Angeles sits atop an underground parking structure built in 1952. In Washington, DC the “Spirit of Justice Park” (completed in 1967) covers two blocks of underground parking south of the Longworth and Rayburn House Office buildings. And development of <a href="https://www.nationalmallunderground.org/">parking under the Mall</a> is being suggested today. <strong>[18]</strong></p>

    in element <p>Local history is a core part of the public library mission–the American Library Association just recently published <em>Local History Reference Collections for Public Libraries</em> articulating trends, practices, users, needs for any public library local history collection. Neighboring Arlington County Library has invested in making its Center of Local History (formerly Virginiana Room) a model public library local history enterprise—but does not match scope of Washingtoniana for current materials. That the architectural renderings for the library renovation give no indication of any substantive research space is rather disturbing. <a href="http://march.rutgers.edu/2016/08/whither-washingtoniana/#mapone">3</a><a href="http://march.rutgers.edu/2016/08/whither-washingtoniana/#_edn1" name="_ednref1"></a></p>

One of the first purpose-built “garages” in Washington is located at 2201 Massachusetts Avenue NW (at Massachusetts, Florida, and 22nd), and, entered through the side alley, forms part of the Miller House, constructed in 1900. The house, designed by Paul J. Pelz, of Library of Congress fame, is now a condominium known as Argyle Terrace. The garage was used for a time by Olga Hirshhorn to house her art collection. Nearby Alice Pike Barney included a garage in <a href="http://intowner.com/2014/02/18/alice-pike-barneys-studio-house-on-sheridan-circle-2">her new home</a> at 2306 Massachusetts Avenue on Sheridan Circle.</p>
